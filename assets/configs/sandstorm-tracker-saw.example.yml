# Simplified Configuration for Sandstorm Admin Wrapper (SAW) Users
#
# If you're using Sandstorm Admin Wrapper, you only need to provide the SAW installation path.
# The tracker will automatically:
#   - Read server-configs.json from SAW
#   - Extract server names, RCON settings, and query ports
#   - Construct log file paths automatically
#
# Usage:
#   sandstorm-tracker --saw-path "C:\path\to\sandstorm-admin-wrapper"
#
# Or set as environment variable:
#   $env:SAW_PATH = "C:\path\to\sandstorm-admin-wrapper"
#   .\sandstorm-tracker.exe
# or you can specify it directly in this config file as seen below.

# SAW Path Configuration
# Provide the root directory where Sandstorm Admin Wrapper is installed
sawPath: "C:\\SAW_1.0.4"

# Logging Configuration (optional - these are defaults)
logging:
  level: "info" # "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
  maxSizeMB: 100 # Rotate when log reaches 100MB
  maxAgeDays: 7 # Rotate logs older than 7 days
  maxBackups: 10 # Keep 10 rotated backup files
  # Note: Log files are automatically dated (e.g., sandstorm-tracker.2025-11-21.log)
# Advanced: Override settings for specific servers (optional)
# If you need to override auto-detected settings, you can add them here
# serverOverrides:
#   "1d6407b7-f51b-4b1d-ad9e-faabbfbb7dde":  # Server UUID from SAW
#     enabled: false  # Disable tracking for this server
#     rconTimeout: 10  # Override timeout
