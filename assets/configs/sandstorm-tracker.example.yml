# This is an EXAMPLE configuration file for sandstorm-tracker
#
# Usage:
#   sandstorm-tracker --config path/to/your-config.yml
#   sandstorm-tracker -c myconfig.yml
#
# For sandstorm-admin-wrapper users:
#   1. Find your server's UUID-based log file in: /opt/sandstorm-admin-wrapper/sandstorm-server/Insurgency/Saved/Logs/
#   2. The filename will look like: abc123-uuid-uuid-uuid-uuid.log
#   3. Copy the FULL path to that specific log file for each server's logPath below
#   4. Each server instance needs its own unique log file path
#
# For standalone server users:
#   - You can use just the directory path (e.g., /opt/sandstorm/Insurgency/Saved/Logs)
#   - The tracker will automatically find and monitor all .log files in that directory
#
# Environment Variable Support:
#   You can override config values with environment variables:
#   - RCON_PASSWORD_0        - Override first server's RCON password
#   - RCON_PASSWORD_1       - Override second server's RCON password
#
#   Example (PowerShell):
#     $env:RCON_PASSWORD_0 = "SecurePassword123"
#     .\sandstorm-tracker.exe
#
#   Example (Linux/Bash):
#     export RCON_PASSWORD_0="SecurePassword123"
#     ./sandstorm-tracker
#
# Security Notes:
# - Keep your actual config file secure (file permissions 600 on Linux/Mac)
# - Use strong, unique RCON passwords for each server
# - Store config files outside of web-accessible directories
# - Use environment variables for sensitive values in production
